- I want to have a list of 10 apps 
- describe navigation flow 
- point out button sizes and colors (think about how easy it is to find them) 
- think about design and layout, describe things that you like or dislike 
- test out fields and signups (put in bad emails and things to look at validation) 
- see what tapping on non button things like images and other objects will do 
- see if apps are using In App purchases 


## Wunderlist
* Liked how the second screen tucks behind the main screen
* Liked how the settings window pops over the others, and you can click the background to access previous screens
* Liked blinking text field

## Bloomberg
* Liked how the top menu is scrollable
* Liked how the inactive buttons a similar shade to the background color
* Liked button that gives option to hide 2nd menu bar

## Epicurious
* Two columns for photos work well
* Like the way scrolling tucks under main menu

## Jetsetter
* Liked how the top left circle is multiple uses. From logo to, to "loading", to back button
* pull down to refresh is nice. Great that it has last refresh time* 


## Groupon
* Don't like the rounded content/photo boxes and the drop shadows.

## ESPN SportCenter
* Looks kind of bland. Need more color or more diverse fonts

## Flixter
* Liked how the top menu buttons reverse the text and background color when you click them.

## Shazam
* liking the white text over darker backgrounds

## WeatherBug
* This app used to be cool. What happened? Something about it reminds me on Android.
* Poorly organized content.
* Photo background is too much.
* Text doesn't highlight when you touch it

* The option of swipping the screen or pressing menu buttons is nice

## Houzz
* The sliding main menu and the way the icons appear is great. Interacts with you without being overbearing 
* The bottom arrows in the menu bar is misleading
* I'm noticing a lot of the apps are using a horizontal rule to seperate lots of text in the slide in menu
* tapping the top part above the menu scrolls to the very top.
